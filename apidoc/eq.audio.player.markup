= Support for audio playback and streaming =

The audio player library is meant for the playback of audio content that is
typically long, and is not read into memory all at once. Typically this is used
for music. For short audio clips (commonly used for sound effects), you should
also look at com.eqela.libaudioclip. The two libraries can be, and commonly are,
used together (libaudioplayer for music, libaudioclip for sound effects).
