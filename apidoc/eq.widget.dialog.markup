= Dialog widgets =

The dialogwidget library contains many commonly used dialogs, such as an error
dialog, message dialog, text input dialog, etc. Dialogs are user interface controls
that are popped up on top of other elements, usually to either provide immediate
output, or to ask input from the user.
