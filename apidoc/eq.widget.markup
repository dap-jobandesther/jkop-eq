= Graphical user interface component library =

The widget library provides a common application model for applications that
are composed of a collection of reusable user interface components (which are
called widgets in Eqela programming). The widget library includes a few commonly
used widgets for the layout of user interface requirements, and provides the
programmer with the ability to extend the functionality by implementing their
own custom widgets.
