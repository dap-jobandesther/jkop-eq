= Support for short audio clips =

The audio clip library provides support for the playback of short audio clips,
commonly used for sound effects. The audio clips used here should be short and
small enough that they can be loaded and maintained in memory. For longer audio
clips (such as music playback), please look at com.eqela.libaudioplayer, which
can be used together with this module.
