= Modal Dialog Library =

The Modal Dialog library provides the ability to display common dialog windows and popups
to inform the user, and to ask information from the user. The dialogs are often implemented
using corresponding native controls, enabling native look and feel on all supported platforms.
In cases where no such native dialogs are available, generic fallback implementations are included.
