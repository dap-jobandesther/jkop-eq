Jkop EQ is an open source software development framework and class library
that targets multiple platforms, operating systems and programming languages,
and provides a rich set of features ranging things like string manipulation,
data structures and threading to graphical user interfaces, web development,
text template processing, mobile application development, etc.

Jkop EQ is the successor and evolution of the framework that used to be
known as the "Eqela API" and was subsequently known as "Eqcellent" for a
brief period of time.

Jkop EQ is fully written in the EQ programming language, and also serves as the
standard development framework for all applications written in EQ. Please
