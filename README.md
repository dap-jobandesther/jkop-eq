About Jkop EQ
-------------

Jkop EQ is an open source software development framework and class library
that targets multiple platforms, operating systems and programming languages,
and provides a rich set of features ranging things like string manipulation,
data structures and threading to graphical user interfaces, web development,
text template processing, mobile application development, etc.

Jkop EQ is the successor and evolution of the framework that used to be
known as the "Eqela API" and was subsequently known as "Eqcellent" for a
brief period of time.

Jkop EQ is fully written in the EQ programming language, and also serves as the
standard development framework for all applications written in EQ. Please
visit http://eqdn.tech/eq for more information about the language.

This library is a component of the Jkop framework project. For more information

To compile the libraries and/or the samples, an EQ compiler is required:
A recent version of the EDK (Eqela Development Kit) includes the compiler (eqc),
and can be downloaded on the Eqela website: http://www.eqela.com/download/

Compile an application with eg.:

```
